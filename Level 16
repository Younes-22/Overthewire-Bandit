The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it. 

 

To do this, I used nmap 

 

I did nmap –p 31000-32000 localhost 

 

This gave me 5 open ports 

 

I then did nmap -p 31046,31518,31691,31790,31960 –A localhost to search through them specifically 

 

All except one had ssl and didn’t have echo. It was ssl/unknown instead and this was port 31790 

 

So I did openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 –ign_eof 

 

Im not sure why but it outputs KEYUPDATE when I don’t do ign_eof 

 

After inserting the password I get the rsa private key
