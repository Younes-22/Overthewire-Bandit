Cd on its own lets you move back to the root directory 

 

Xxd to referse a hex dump via xxd -r data.txt data2.txt 

 

Stores it in data2.txt 

 

Use file data2.txt to find how the data was compressed. In this case it's gzip compressed that was previously data2.bin 

 

So lets rename the data2.txt to what it should be 

 

 

Mv data2.txt data2.bin.gz 

 

Now we do gunzip data2.bin.gz to uncompress it 

 

Now its no longer gzip compress. However when we do fiel data2.bin, we see that it's bzip2 compressed 

 

So we repeat but with bzip instead 

 

Mv data2.bin data2.bin.bz2 

 

Bunzip2 data2.txt 

 

Again this is gzip compressed so we do the same except it says it was previously data4.bin so we call it that 

 

After unzipping and doing file data4.bin, we see itâ€™s a POSIX tar archive  

 

So same presdure make it mv data4.bin.tar 

 

To unzip do tar -xf data4.bin.tar 

 

And keep unzipping until the files becomes ascii text and you can get the password
