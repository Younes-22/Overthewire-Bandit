The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters. 

To solve this, I need to use the strings and grep commands 

Since I want human readable, strings command to only give me human readable data 

So its strings data.txt | grep == 

Grep == shows me the line where == is used, hence I find the password
