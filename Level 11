The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data 

 

ROT13 

 

The solution requires the use of tr which is for translating or deleting characters 

 

First do cat data.txt to take the characters within. Use a pipeline and tr to set the alphabet in normal order both in lower and upper case, then for the second argument do it in rot13 order 

 

e.g. cat data.txt | tr abcd…ABCD… nopqr…NOPQR 

 

This'll translate and output the password 

 

Alternatively using a-zA-Z instead of just typing the whole alphabet works too
