The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: 

 human-readable 

1033 bytes in size  

not executable 


Here's how to do it: 

Use the find command t 

Find . -readable –size 1033c ! -executable 

 

The . After find means search in the current directory 

If I wasn’t in the inhere directory, I would have inhere instead of . 

 

The c stands for bytes as in character bytes in 1033
