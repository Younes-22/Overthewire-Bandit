The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once 

To do this the sort command and the uniq command need to be used 

This solution is sort data.txt | uniq -u 

The first part sorts it in lexical order so that duplicates are next to eachother 

Unique -u makes sure to check the values adjacent to each value and only outputs if they're unique
