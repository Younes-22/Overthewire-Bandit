# Overthewire-Bandit Walkthrough Notes

This repository contains my personal notes from completing levels 0 to 20 of the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame. Bandit is a beginner-friendly Linux-based security challenge designed to teach essential command-line skills, file permissions, and basic scripting.

## Why I Did This

As part of deepening my understanding of Linux and shell environments, I worked through each level of Bandit and documented the tools, commands, and logic I used to solve them. This helped me:

- Familiarize myself with key Linux utilities
- Practice navigating the filesystem securely
- Reinforce concepts like redirection, file permissions, and SSH

## What's Inside

- Step-by-step solutions from Level 1 to Level 20
- Explanations of each challenge and how I approached it
- Command breakdowns to highlight what worked and why

## Note

These notes are primarily for personal reference, but others may find them helpful as a learning resource. I recommend trying each level yourself before peeking at the solutions.
